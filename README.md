# Hangman ðŸ¤¯
Course Assignment

</br>

## Project Description :
In this project, you will create a text-based Hangman game using Python.
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word
by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project will help
you practice fundamental Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions,
and string manipulation.

## Project Requirements :
1. Word List:
Create a list of words from which the game will randomly choose a word
for the player to guess.

2. Game Logic:
The computer selects a random word from the word list.
The player is prompted to guess letters one at a time.
The game should display the word with underscores for each letter not yet
guessed (e.g., "_ _ _ _" for a 4-letter word).
The game should keep track of the letters the player has guessed.
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (e.g., 6). If the player
reaches this limit, they lose the game.
If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word before reaching
the limit of incorrect guesses, they win the game.

3. User Interface:
The game should display the current state of the word (with guessed
letters filled in and unguessed letters as underscores).
The game should display the letters the player has already guessed.
The game should display the number of incorrect guesses remaining.

4. Ending the Game:
The game should end when the player either guesses the word correctly
or runs out of incorrect guesses.
At the end of the game, display a message indicating whether the player
won or lost, and reveal the word.

5. Code Structure:
Use functions to organize your code. For example, you might have
functions for displaying the current state of the word, checking the
player's guess, and updating the game state.
Use clear and descriptive variable names.
